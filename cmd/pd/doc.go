// pd is a Pixeldrain client application.
//
// # Usage
//
// pd has two subcommands: upload and download.
//
// upload command uploads files specified by the given paths to Pixeldrain and shows a URL to download them.
//
//	$ pd upload <path[:name]>...
//
// Each path can have an optional name. If a name is given, uploaded file will be renamed with it.
// For example, this command reads img.png and uploads it as another.png:
//
//	$ pd upload img.png:another.png
//
// If path is "-", the uploading file is read from stdin. In this case, it's recommended to give a file name.
// For example, this command reads data from stdin and uploads it as output.log:
//
//	$ pd upload -:output.log
//
// If multiple files are given, an album consists of them will be created. By default, the album has a random name.
// --album flag can specify the name.
// For example, this command uploads two files and creates an album named "screenshots":
//
//	$ pd upload --album screenshots img1.png img2.png
//
// download command downloads files from Pixeldrain to the current directory.
//
//	$ pd download <URL>...
//
// If --dir or -o option is given with a directory path, the downloaded file is stored in the directory.
//
// For example, this command downloads a file URL into ~/Download:
//
//	$ pd download URL -o ~/Download
//
// If recipients are specified with --recipient and/or --recipient-file flags to upload command,
// files will be encrypted before being uploaded by age.
// Encrypted files will have extension .age.
//
// A recipient specified with --recipient flag can be an age public key generated by age-keygen ("age1...")
// or an SSH public key ("ssh-ed25519 AAAA...", "ssh-rsa AAAA...").
// A recipient file specified with --recipient-file flag contains one or more recipients, one per line.
// Empty line sand lines starting with "#" are ignored as comments.
//
// If a downloading file has extension .age and an identity file is specified with --identity flag to download command,
// the file will be decrypted.
//
// An identity contains one or more secret keys ("AGE-SECRET-KEY-1..."), one per line, or an SSH key.
// Empty lines and lines starting with "#" are ignored as comments.
//
// See https://github.com/FiloSottile/age for the details of age and age-keygen.
